Patients with critical conditions in need of close monitoring and medical care will be admitted or transferred to intensive care units (ICUs). Because of the nature of their conditions, patients in ICUs often have a higher mortality rate than patients in regular wards.\n",

The data was gathered from the Philips CareVue Clinical Information System and iMDsoft MetaVision ICU. MIMIC-III is available to researchers worldwide for data study including performing various data science tasks.\n",

        "This notebook aims to utilize data science procedures on the MIMIC-III data to 1) build a predictive algorithm based on data from the first 24 hours in the ICU and 2) to investigate whether admission to the ICU on weekends increases the risk of ICU mortality."
