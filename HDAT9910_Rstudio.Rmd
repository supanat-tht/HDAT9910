# Introduction

Patients admitted to hospitals are sent to the appropriate wards depending on their conditions. Patients with critical conditions in need of close monitoring and medical care will be admitted or transferred to intensive care units (ICUs). Because of the nature of their conditions, patients in ICUs often have a higher mortality rate than patients in regular wards.

MIMIC-III is a large database containing deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in the intensive care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, between 2001 and 2012. The data was gathered from the Philips CareVue Clinical Information System and iMDsoft MetaVision ICU. MIMIC-III is available to researchers worldwide for data study including performing various data science tasks.

This notebook aims to utilize data science procedures on the MIMIC-III data to 1) build a predictive algorithm based on data from the first 24 hours in the ICU and 2) to investigate whether admission to the ICU on weekends increases the risk of ICU mortality.

## Characteristic of the MIMIC-III data

The MIMIC-III database is a joint database from the CareVue and MetaVision systems. The data were collected during routine care, not for research purposes. The data were deidentified by removing personally identifiable information. Further deidentification was done by offsetting dates into the future (2100-2200) and shifting the ages of patients older than 89 years to 91.4. The data do not only include adult patients, but also newborns.

## Research questions

1.  Is it possible to accurately predict mortality based on data from the first 24 hours in ICU?

-   Study population: Adult patients older than 18 years old admitted to the ICU from January 2006 to December 2014. Only the first ICU admission for each patient is included. ICU stays with length of stay under 24 hours or unknown are not included.
-   Study outcome: ICU mortality

2.  Does admission to ICU over the weekend increase the risk of mortality?

-   Study population: Adult patients older than 18 years old admitted to the ICU from January 2006 to December 2014. Only the first ICU admission for each patient is included. ICU stays with length of stay under 24 hours or unknown are not included. Only data from the first 24 hours in ICU are included.
-   Intervention: Admission to ICU over the weekend
-   Comparison: Admission to ICU over the weekdays
-   Study outcome: ICU mortality

## Structure of the report

-   Data cleaning and exploration, and Research Question 2 are done using R. Unrendered and rendered versions of the report are in R markdown and HTML files.
-   Research Question 1 is done using Python. Unrendered and rendered versions of the report are in Jupyter Notebook and PDF files.

## `pt_icu_outcome` data

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Overview of the data frame
# This data frame will be the backbone of the data
Hmisc::describe(pt_icu_outcome)
```

This dataset contains age, death flag, length of ICU stay, and time of hospital and ICU admission and discharge. There are `r nrow(pt_icu_outcome)` ICU stays of `r n_distinct(pt_icu_outcome$subject_id)` distinct patients. The ICU stay ID should be unique each row. However, there is a duplicate ID (`icustay_id` count = `r nrow(pt_icu_outcome)`; distinct count = `r n_distinct(pt_icu_outcome$icustay_id)`). The age of patients older than 89 years old has been shifted to 91.4 as indicated [here](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iii/tables/patients/).

```{r include=FALSE}
# Identify duplicated `icustay_id`
pt_icu_outcome %>% filter(duplicated(icustay_id)) # The duplicated `icustay_id` is 229922.
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Display observations where `icustay_id` = 229922
pt_icu_outcome %>% filter(icustay_id == 229922)

# Because the only difference between the two duplicated observations is the hospital admission time, and it is not possible to determine which one is correct, both of them will be excluded.
pt_icu_outcome_nodup <- pt_icu_outcome %>% filter(icustay_id != 229922)
```

Patient No. 5246 has duplicated ICU stay ID 229922. Because the only difference between the two duplicated observations is the hospital admission time, and it is not possible to determine which one is correct, both of the entries were excluded.

```{r include=FALSE}
# Keep only the first ICU stay of each patient
# Keep only adult patients (age >= 18)
pt_icu_outcome_adult <- pt_icu_outcome_nodup %>% 
  filter(!duplicated(subject_id)) %>%
  filter(age_years >= 18)
```

Only the first ICU stay of each patient that lasted at least 24 hours was kept, and patients younger than 18 years old were excluded.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# count patients died in the ICU
table(pt_icu_outcome_adult$icu_expire_flag)
```

The ICU expire flag is "yes" to only `r round(216*100/(38293+216), 2)`% of patients, which is much lower than the [published ICU mortality rate](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635/tables/2) of the data. A new ICU expire flag was created based on the original expire flag and the recorded death time. Patients with death date occurring during the ICU stay were considered "yes" to the expire flag. A new weekend flag telling whether ICU admissions occurred on weekends was also created.

```{r include=FALSE}
# Create my own ICU expire flag
# Transform date variables to date_time variables and add "_d" to the variable names
pt_icu_outcome_asdate <- pt_icu_outcome_adult %>% mutate(admittime_d = ymd_hms(admittime),
                                                         dischtime_d = ymd_hms(dischtime),
                                                         intime_d = ymd_hms(intime),
                                                         outtime_d = ymd_hms(outtime),
                                                         hosp_deathtime_d = ymd_hms(hosp_deathtime),
                                                         dod_d = ymd_hms(dod))

# Second, filter only patients who stayed in ICU >= 24 hr
pt_icu_outcome_asdate_2 <- pt_icu_outcome_asdate %>%
  filter(outtime_d - intime_d >= 86400) %>% # filter out 5,951 patients with ICU duration <24 hr. 86,400 seconds = 24 hours.
  filter(!is.na(outtime_d)) %>% # filter out 2 patients whose ICU exit times were missing.
  filter(subject_id != 10518) # filter out 1 patient (ID 10518) with date of death occurred before hospital admission date.

# Check the ICU expire flag
# First, confirm that `intime_d` and `outtime_d` are in chronological order.
summary(pt_icu_outcome_asdate_2$outtime_d >= pt_icu_outcome_asdate_2$intime_d)
# Yes, all entries are in chronological order.

# Check the expire flag and ICU expire flag
table(pt_icu_outcome_asdate_2$expire_flag, pt_icu_outcome_asdate_2$icu_expire_flag)
# There are no records where icu_expire_flag = 1 but expire_flag = 0, which is good.

# I will create my own ICU expire flag by flagging patients who died while they were staying in an ICU.
# Because there are 2,561 patients who died before or on the ICU exit date but flagged 0.
pt_icu_outcome_expflag <- pt_icu_outcome_asdate_2 %>% 
  mutate(icu_expire_flag_2 = ifelse(is.na(dod_d), 0, 
                                    ifelse(dod_d <= outtime_d, 1, icu_expire_flag))
         )

# Check the new variable
sum(pt_icu_outcome_expflag$icu_expire_flag_2, na.rm=TRUE)
# There 2,561 ICU mortality, which account for 7.87% of ICU patients. This rate is comparable to the published rate.

# add weekend flag
pt_icu_outcome_wkndflag <- pt_icu_outcome_expflag %>%
  mutate(weekend = ifelse(lubridate::wday(intime_d) %in% c(1, 7), 1, 0))
# 6,897 out of 32,555 ICU admissions (21.2%) are on weekends.

# I will use this flag as the outcome. Dropping unused variables.
pt_icu_outcome_clean <- pt_icu_outcome_wkndflag %>% select(!c("admittime", "dischtime", "intime", "outtime", "hosp_deathtime", "dod", "icu_expire_flag", "ttd_days"))
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# sanity check
Hmisc::describe(pt_icu_outcome_clean)
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
head(pt_icu_outcome_clean)
```

As a result, `r nrow(pt_icu_outcome_clean)` patient aged 18 years old and older with their first ICU stay lasting at least 24 hours were included. The ICU mortality rate is `r round(2561*100/32555, 2)`%, comparable to the published rate. The rate here is different to the published rate because this is a subset of the published population.

## `patients` data

```{r patients, include=FALSE}
# I want to retrieve gender from this data set
# Filter to the subject IDs that I need
patients_2 <- patients %>% 
  filter(subject_id %in% pt_icu_outcome_clean$subject_id) %>%
  select(subject_id, gender)

# see gender
describe(patients_2$gender)
# Of 32,555 patients, 56.8% of them are male. There are no missing values.
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
head(patients_2)
```

I obtained gender of the included patients from this dataset. 56.8% of them were male.

## `admissions` data

```{r admissions, include=FALSE}
# Filter to the hospital admission IDs that I need
admissions_2 <- admissions %>%
  filter(hadm_id %in% pt_icu_outcome_clean$hadm_id) %>%
  select(subject_id, hadm_id, admission_type, admission_location, insurance, language, religion, marital_status, ethnicity)

# Because there are few "urgent" type of admission, I will combine them with "emergency".
admissions_3 <- admissions_2 %>%
  mutate(admission_type_2 = ifelse(admission_type == "URGENT", "EMERGENCY", admission_type),
         admission_type_2 = ifelse(admission_type_2 == "EMERGENCY", "EMERGENCY/URGENT", admission_type))

# Group ethnicity to white, black, and other/unknown
# 3,184 patients are "unknown/not specified", and 664 patiens are "unable to obtain".
admissions_4 <- admissions_3 %>%
  mutate(ethnicity_2 = ifelse(grepl("WHITE|PORTUGUESE", ethnicity), "WHITE", 
                              ifelse(grepl("BLACK", ethnicity), "BLACK", "OTHER/UNKNOWN")))
# sanity check with table(admissions_4$ethnicity, admissions_4$ethnicity_2) OK

# keep only variables that I will be using
admissions_5 <- admissions_4 %>% select(subject_id, hadm_id, admission_type_2, ethnicity_2)

# overview of the data
describe(admissions_5)
# Of 32,555 admissions included, 83.7% of them are emergency/urgent admissions. 71.3% of patients are white, while 7.5% of them are black.
```

```{r}
table(admissions_5$admission_type_2)
table(admissions_5$ethnicity_2)
```

I obtained the admission type and ethnicity from this dataset. The admission type was collapse to elective and emergency/urgent. The ethnicity was collapse to white, black, and other/unknown.

## `icustays` data

```{r icustays, include=FALSE}
# Filter to the ICU stay IDs that I need
icustays_2 <- icustays %>%
  filter(icustay_id %in% pt_icu_outcome_clean$icustay_id) %>%
  select(subject_id, hadm_id, icustay_id, first_careunit)

describe(icustays_2)
# 32,555 ICU stays included. The majority of them (34.4%) were initially admitted to MICU.
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
table(icustays_2$first_careunit)
```

I obtained the first care unit data from this dataset. Of the included patients, the majority of them (34.4%) were initially admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU).

## `vitals_hourly` data

```{r vitals_hourly, include=FALSE}
# Filter to the ICU stay IDs that I need and limit the bedside measurements to the first 24 hours
vitals_hourly_24hr <- vitals_hourly %>% 
  filter(icustay_id %in% pt_icu_outcome_clean$icustay_id) %>%
  filter(hr <= 24)

# Overview of the file
Hmisc::describe(vitals_hourly_24hr)
```

This dataset contains hourly data of the bedside measurements. The spO2, temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, glucose, and mean arterial blood pressure have unrealistic values. For example, glucose as low as `r min(vitals_hourly_24hr$glucose, na.rm=T)` and as high as 999999 are not possible using the blood glucose monitor.

```{r}
summary(vitals_hourly_24hr$glucose)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# Clean values out of plausible ranges
# FiO2 is already in the plausible range.
vitals_hourly_24hr_trimmed <- vitals_hourly_24hr %>% 
  mutate(spo2 = replace_out_of_range(spo2, "Oxygen saturation"),
         temperature = replace_out_of_range(temperature, "Temperature"),
         resprate = replace_out_of_range(resprate, "Respiratory rate"),
         heartrate = replace_out_of_range(heartrate, "Heart rate"),
         sysbp = replace_out_of_range(sysbp, "Systolic blood pressure"),
         diasbp = replace_out_of_range(diasbp, "Diastolic blood pressure"),
         glucose = replace_out_of_range(glucose, "Glucose"),
         meanarterialpressure = replace_out_of_range(meanarterialpressure, "Mean blood pressure")
         ) %>%
  select(!c("hr")) # drop `hr` variable

# Create 24hr max and min variables for each measurement
vitals_hourly_24hr_minmax <- vitals_hourly_24hr_trimmed %>%
  group_by(icustay_id) %>%
  summarise_all(list(min = ~collapse::fmin(., na.rm = TRUE), max = ~collapse::fmax(., na.rm = TRUE)))
```

I trimmed variables containing unrealistic values with a predefined ranges. Values outside of outlier ranges were marked missing. Non-outlier values outside of physiologically valid ranges were replaced with the nearest valid values. I then obtained maximum and minimum values of each measurement within the first 24 hours and transformed the dataset from a long format into one row per patient.

```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(vitals_hourly_24hr_minmax)
```

## `labs_hourly` data

```{r labs_hourly, include=FALSE}
# Filter to the ICU stay IDs that I need and limit the data to the first 24 hours
labs_hourly_24hr <- labs_hourly %>% 
  filter(icustay_id %in% pt_icu_outcome_clean$icustay_id) %>%
  filter(hr >=0 & hr <= 24)

# overview of the data
Hmisc::describe(labs_hourly_24hr)
```

This dataset contains hourly measurement of laboratory tests. A large number of variables originally contained out-of-range values. For example, the minimum hemoglobin is 0, and the maximum hemoglobin is 108.

```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(labs_hourly_24hr$hemoglobin)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# Clean values out of plausible ranges
# partialpressureo2, lactate, troponin, bloodureanitrogen, creatinine, alaninetransaminase, aspartatetransaminase, hemoglobin, platelets, albumin, chloride, glucose, sodium, and bilirubin need to be trimmed
labs_hourly_24hr_trimmed <- labs_hourly_24hr %>% 
  mutate(partialpressureo2 = replace_out_of_range(partialpressureo2, "Partial pressure of oxygen"),
         lactate = replace_out_of_range(lactate, "Lactate"),
         troponin = replace_out_of_range(troponin, "Troponin-T"), # assuming troponin-T for troponin
         bloodureanitrogen = replace_out_of_range(bloodureanitrogen, "Blood urea nitrogen"),
         creatinine = replace_out_of_range(creatinine, "Creatinine"),
         alaninetransaminase = replace_out_of_range(alaninetransaminase, "Alanine aminotransferase"),
         aspartatetransaminase = replace_out_of_range(aspartatetransaminase, "Asparate aminotransferase"),
         hemoglobin = replace_out_of_range(hemoglobin, "Hemoglobin"),
         platelets = replace_out_of_range(platelets, "Platelets"),
         albumin = replace_out_of_range(albumin, "Albumin"),
         chloride = replace_out_of_range(chloride, "Chloride"),
         glucose = replace_out_of_range(glucose, "Glucose"),
         sodium = replace_out_of_range(sodium, "Sodium"),
         bilirubin = replace_out_of_range(bilirubin, "Bilirubin")
         ) %>%
  select(!c("hr")) # drop `hr` variable

# Create 24hr max and min variables for each measurement
labs_hourly_24hr_minmax <- labs_hourly_24hr_trimmed %>%
  group_by(icustay_id) %>%
  summarise_all(list(min = ~collapse::fmin(., na.rm = TRUE), max = ~collapse::fmax(., na.rm = TRUE)))
```

After value trimming, the dataset was transformed from a long format to one row per patient, containing maximum and minimum values within the first 24 hours of each patient.

```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(labs_hourly_24hr_minmax)
```

## `gcs_hourly` data

```{r gcs_hourly, include=FALSE}
# Filter to the ICU stay IDs that I need and limit the data to the first 24 hours
gcs_hourly_24hr <- gcs_hourly %>% 
  filter(icustay_id %in% pt_icu_outcome_clean$icustay_id) %>%
  filter(hr >=0 & hr <= 24)

# overview of the data
Hmisc::describe(gcs_hourly_24hr)
# GCS is in the expected range (3-15 scores).
```

```{r include=FALSE}

This dataset contains urine output measurements in a long format. The total 24-hour urine output was calculated from the available data, and the out-of-range values were trimmed. As a results, `r output_hourly_24hr_trimmed %>% filter(is.na(totalurine24)) %>% nrow()` out of `r output_hourly_24hr_trimmed %>% nrow()` patients do not have a valid uring output measurement.

## Joining everything to a single data set

I joined all datasets above by either subject ID or ICU stay ID to create a single large dataset. I assigned 1 ("yes") to mechanical ventilation for patients who were on endotrachial tube. Percentages of missing values in each variable are shown below.

```{r join, include=FALSE}
alldata <- pt_icu_outcome_clean %>%
  left_join(patients_2, by="subject_id") %>%

# glucose_max.x and glucose_min.x are from vitals_hourly_24hr_minmax, while glucose_max.y and glucose_min.y are from labs_hourly_24hr_minmax. Since there are fewer missing values in ~max.x, I will substitute missing values in ~.x with ~.y.
alldata_2 <- alldata %>%
  mutate(glucose_max.x = ifelse(is.na(glucose_max.x), glucose_max.y, glucose_max.x),
         glucose_min.x = ifelse(is.na(glucose_min.x), glucose_min.y, glucose_min.x))

# There are some inconsistencies between the endotracheal flag and mechanical ventilation because if on endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation should also be on.
# table(alldata_2$endotrachflag, alldata_2$mechvent_24hr)
# Assign 1 to mechanical ventilation for everybody with endotracheal tube
alldata_3 <- alldata_2 %>%

```

```{r echo=TRUE}
# percentages of missing values in each variable
colSums(is.na(alldata_3))/nrow(alldata_3)*100
```

I excluded variables with more than 10% missing values, replaced missing values of continuous variables with the median, and replaced missing values of binary variables with 0 ("No"). After excluding time variables and ID variables, all remaining variables were included in an analysis-ready dataset for Question 2. Meanwhile, the dataset for Question 1 was one-hot encoded and lacks variables that could not be obtained within the first 24 hours of ICU admission, including the length of stay, blood culture, and antibiotic resistance. Additionally, variables indicating diagnoses were also removed from the Question 1 dataset because it is difficult to distinguish between known diagnoses and those obtained at discharge. A rough idea of the reason for admission can be obtained from the type of admission and the first care unit. The dataset for Question 1 was exported as a .csv file for use with Google Colab.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset provides data on `r nrow(alldata_final)` patients aged 18 years or older who were admitted to stayed in ICU 24 hours or longer. The dataset contains only the first ICU admission of each patient. As shown in Table 1, the age ranged from `r min(alldata_final$age_years)` to `r max(alldata_final$age_years)` years, with a median of `r median(alldata_final$age_years)` years (interquartile range (IQR): `r quantile(alldata_final$age_years, 0.25)`-`r quantile(alldata_final$age_years, 0.75)` years), and 56.8% of patients were men. Most patients (71.3%) were white. 6,897 patients (21.2%) were admitted to ICU on weekends. Most admissions (83.7%) were either emergency or urgent. Most patients were first admitted to medical ICUs (MICU) (34.4%) and cardiac surgery recovery units (CSRU) (21.4%). Most common groups of diagnoses were other (92.8%) and circulatory disorders (83.7%). 26.5% of patients were intubated within the first 24 hours. Length of stay ranged from 1 to 153.9 days with a median of 2.5 days (IQR: 1.6-4.8 days). 2,561 patients (7.87%) died in their first ICU admissions. Patients who died in their ICU stays tended to be older, stayed longer, be admitted to ICU for emergency or urgent conditions, and undergo endotracheal intubation compared to those those who did not die.

From the Figure 1 below, age, length of stay, minimum blood urea nitrogen, minimum GSC score, and maximum GCS score (Fig. 1A-1C, 1E, 1F) seem to differ between patients who died and did not died during their ICU stays. However, the minimum hematocrit (Fig. 1D) seems to not differ between the two categories.

# Question 2: Weekend effect in ICU

Task: To investigate whether admission to ICU at the weekend increases the risk of ICU mortality

Objective: To develop a statistical model to estimate the effect of weekend admission to ICU on the risk of ICU mortality.

Question: Does admission to ICU over the weekend increase the risk of ICU mortality?

Study Population: First ICU admissions of adults in the MIMIC-III dataset

## Solution

I have chosen specific variables for plotting survival curves. In Figure 2, the survival rates of ICU patients do not appear to differ between weekend and weekday admissions upon visual inspection. However, with a p-value of 0.018, there's a statistically significant distinction. In the same figure, patients admitted to the ICU electively evidently exhibited higher survival rates compared to those admitted on an emergency or urgent basis (p \< 0.0001). While the survival curves for ICU patients stratified by endotracheal intubation seem to overlap, a p-value of 0.00021 indicates a statistically significant difference

To develop the best model explaining the effect of the weekend admission on the ICU survival, univariate Cox models for each variables in the dataset were fitted. A multivariable Cox model including all of the variables that were statistically significant in the univariable Cox models were consequently fitted. The univariate and multivariate models are shown in Table 2. Interestingly, patients admitted to ICU during weekends were 11% more likely to die in ICU (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.22). However, this association was not seen in the multivariate model (hazard ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.88-1.05).

# model comparison with AIC values
extractAIC(multi_1)
extractAIC(multi_2)
# The smaller model provides a smaller AIC value. Thus, the smaller model is preferred.
```

Model comparison with ANOVA test showed a nonsignificant p-value (\> 0.05) suggesting that the smaller model (`multi_2`, Table 3) is preferred. The smaller model also has a smaller AIC value (42985.95), suggesting that the smaller model is preferred.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# test for Cox proportional hazards assumption
cox.zph(multi_2)
```

The test for Cox proportional hazards assumption indicates that the proportional hazards assumption is violated for a large portion of variables (p \< 0.05). The global test also indicates the assumption is invalid (p \< 0.05). To address these issues, continuous variables were categorized, and categorical variables were stratified (Table 4).

After addressing Cox proportional hazards assumption violation for `multi_3` model in Table 4, p-values of `diasbp_min`, `hematocrit_min`, and `hematocrit_max` became nonsignificant. Excluding `diasbp_min` and `hematocrit_max` resulted in a lower AIC value (`multi_4` model, Table 5)

```{r}
# After categorization, p-values of `diasbp_min`, `hematocrit_min`, and `hematocrit_max` became nonsignificant in the multivariate model. I will try excluding them from the model and see their impact on the AIC.
multi_4 <- coxph(Surv(los, icu_expire_flag_2) ~ weekend + age_years + strata(admission_type_2) + ethnicity_2 + strata(Genitourinary) + strata(Neoplasms) + Trauma + strata(first_careunit) + spo2_min + temperature_min + sysbp_min  + glucose_min.x + meanarterialpressure_min + spo2_max + temperature_max + resprate_max + heartrate_max + whitebloodcell_min + bicarbonate_min + bloodureanitrogen_min + chloride_min + bloodureanitrogen_max + sodium_max + hematocrit_min + gcs_min + gcs_max + strata(endotrachflag) + weight + strata(mechvent_24hr), data = alldata_q2_partialcat)

tbl_regression(multi_4, 
               exponentiate = TRUE,
               label = list(age_years ~ "Age (years)",
                     weekend ~ "Weekend admission",
                     ethnicity_2 ~ "Ethnicity",
                     Trauma ~ "Diagnosis: Trauma",

```{r echo=TRUE}
# model comparison with AIC values

There are still some variables that violate the Cox proportional hazards assumption. These violations were addressed in `multi_5` model (Table 6).

## Final model

```{r}
# categorize continuous variables that violates the proportional hazards assumption
alldata_q2_partialcat_2 <- alldata_q2_partialcat %>%
  mutate(temperature_min = cut_continuous(temperature_min, "Temperature"),
         bloodureanitrogen_min = cut_continuous(bloodureanitrogen_min, "Blood urea nitrogen"),
         bloodureanitrogen_max = cut_continuous(bloodureanitrogen_max, "Blood urea nitrogen"),
         sodium_max = cut_continuous(sodium_max, "Sodium"))

# stratify categorical variables that violates the proportional hazards assumption
multi_5 <- coxph(Surv(los, icu_expire_flag_2) ~ weekend + age_years + strata(admission_type_2) + ethnicity_2 + strata(Genitourinary) + strata(Neoplasms) + strata(Trauma) + strata(first_careunit) + strata(spo2_min) + temperature_min + strata(sysbp_min)  + strata(glucose_min.x) + strata(meanarterialpressure_min) + spo2_max + strata(temperature_max) + resprate_max + strata(heartrate_max) + whitebloodcell_min + strata(bicarbonate_min) + bloodureanitrogen_min + chloride_min + bloodureanitrogen_max + sodium_max + hematocrit_min + strata(gcs_min) + strata(gcs_max) + strata(endotrachflag) + weight + strata(mechvent_24hr), data = alldata_q2_partialcat_2)

tbl_regression(multi_5, 
               exponentiate = TRUE,
               label = list(age_years ~ "Age (years)",
                     weekend ~ "Weekend admission",
                     ethnicity_2 ~ "Ethnicity",
                     weight ~ "Weight (kg)")) %>%
  bold_p() %>%
  modify_caption("**Table 6. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression from Table 5 without Cox proportional hazards assumption violations**")
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
# model comparison with AIC values
extractAIC(multi_4)
extractAIC(multi_5)

# test for Cox proportional hazards assumption
cox.zph(multi_5)
```

The AIC value of the final model (`multi_5`) notably decreased compared to that of the `multi_4` model, down to 2591.418. The global test for Cox proportional hazards assumptions confirms no violations, with a p-value greater than 0.05. As shown in Table 6, this model suggests that weekend admission is not associated with ICU mortality (hazard ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.74-1.05).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, according to the univariate Cox proportional hazards model, patients admitted to the ICU on weekends were more likely to pass away in the ICU compared to those admitted on weekdays. However, in the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, which included variable selection, categorization, and stratification, weekend admission was not found to be associated with ICU mortality.
