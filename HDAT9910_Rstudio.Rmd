# Introduction

Patients admitted to hospitals are sent to the appropriate wards depending on their conditions. Patients with critical conditions in need of close monitoring and medical care will be admitted or transferred to intensive care units (ICUs). Because of the nature of their conditions, patients in ICUs often have a higher mortality rate than patients in regular wards.

MIMIC-III is a large database containing deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in the intensive care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, between 2001 and 2012. The data was gathered from the Philips CareVue Clinical Information System and iMDsoft MetaVision ICU. MIMIC-III is available to researchers worldwide for data study including performing various data science tasks.

This notebook aims to utilize data science procedures on the MIMIC-III data to 1) build a predictive algorithm based on data from the first 24 hours in the ICU and 2) to investigate whether admission to the ICU on weekends increases the risk of ICU mortality.

## Characteristic of the MIMIC-III data

The MIMIC-III database is a joint database from the CareVue and MetaVision systems. The data were collected during  routine care, not for research purposes. The data were deidentified by removing personally identifiable information. Further deidentification was done by offsetting dates into the future (2100-2200) and shifting the ages of patients older than 89 years to 91.4. The data do not only include adult patients, but also newborns.

## Research questions
1. Is it possible to accurately predict mortality based on data from the first 24 hours in ICU?
* Study population: Adult patients older than 18 years old admitted to the ICU from January 2006 to December 2014. Only the first ICU admission of each patient will be included. ICU stays with length of stay under 24 hours or unknown are not included.
* Study outcome: ICU mortality

1. Does admission to ICU over the weekend increase the risk of mortality?
* Study population: Adult patients older than 18 years old admitted to the ICU from January 2006 to December 2014. Only the first ICU admission of each patient will be included. ICU stays with length of stay under 24 hours or unknown are not included.
* Intervention: Admission to ICU over the weekend
* Comparison: Admission to ICU over the weekdays
* Study outcome: ICU mortality

## Structure of the report
* Data cleaning and exploration, and Research Question 2 are done using R. Unrendered and rendered versions of the report are in R markdown and HTML files.
* Research Question 1 is done using Python. Unrendered and rendered versions of the report are in Jupyter Notebook and PDF files.

## `pt_icu_outcome` data

```{r}
# Overview of the data frame
# This data frame will be the backbone of the data
Hmisc::describe(pt_icu_outcome)
```

There are 61,533 ICU stays of 46,476 distinct patients because some patients had more than one ICU stays. The ICU stay ID should be unique each row. However, there is a duplicate ID (`icustay_id` count = `r nrow(pt_icu_outcome)`; distinct count = `r n_distinct(pt_icu_outcome$icustay_id)`). The age of patients older than 89 years old has been shifted to 91.4 as indicated [here](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iii/tables/patients/). The `icu_expire_flag` shows that `r sum(pt_icu_outcome$icu_expire_flag)` patients died during ICU stays.

```{r}
# Identify duplicated `icustay_id`
pt_icu_outcome %>% filter(duplicated(icustay_id)) # The duplicated `icustay_id` is 229922.

# Display observations where `icustay_id` = 229922
pt_icu_outcome %>% filter(icustay_id == 229922)

# Because the only difference between the two duplicated observations is the hospital admission time, and it is not possible to determine which one is correct, both of them will be excluded.
pt_icu_outcome_nodup <- pt_icu_outcome %>% filter(icustay_id != 229922)
```
Patient No. 5246 has duplicated ICU stay ID 229922. Because the only difference between the two duplicated observations is the hospital admission time, and it is not possible to determine which one is correct, both of the entries were excluded.

```{r}
# Keep only the first ICU stay of each patient
# Keep only adult patients (age >= 18)
pt_icu_outcome_adult <- pt_icu_outcome_nodup %>% 
  filter(!duplicated(subject_id)) %>%
  filter(age_years >= 18)
```

Only the first ICU stay of each patient that lasted at least 24 hours was kept, and patients younger than 18 years old were excluded. 

```{r}
# count patients died in the ICU
table(pt_icu_outcome_adult$icu_expire_flag)
```
The ICU expire flag is yes to only `r round(216*100/(38293+216), 2)`% of patients, which is much lower than the [published ICU mortality rate](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635/tables/2) of the data. I need to look more into it.

```{r}
# Create my own ICU expire flag
# Transform date variables to date_time variables and add "_d" to the variable names
pt_icu_outcome_asdate <- pt_icu_outcome_adult %>% mutate(admittime_d = ymd_hms(admittime),
                                                         dischtime_d = ymd_hms(dischtime),
                                                         intime_d = ymd_hms(intime),
                                                         outtime_d = ymd_hms(outtime),
                                                         hosp_deathtime_d = ymd_hms(hosp_deathtime),
                                                         dod_d = ymd_hms(dod))

# Second, filter only patients who stayed in ICU >= 24 hr
pt_icu_outcome_asdate_2 <- pt_icu_outcome_asdate %>%
  filter(outtime_d - intime_d >= 86400) %>% # filter out 5,951 patients with ICU duration <24 hr. 86,400 seconds = 24 hours.
  filter(!is.na(outtime_d)) %>% # filter out 2 patients whose ICU exit times were missing.
  filter(subject_id != 10518) # filter out 1 patient (ID 10518) with date of date occurred before hospital admission date.

# Check the ICU expire flag
# First, confirm that `intime_d` and `outtime_d` are in chronological order.
summary(pt_icu_outcome_asdate_2$outtime_d >= pt_icu_outcome_asdate_2$intime_d)
# Yes, all entries are in chronological order.

# Check the expire flag and ICU expire flag
table(pt_icu_outcome_asdate_2$expire_flag, pt_icu_outcome_asdate_2$icu_expire_flag)
# There are no records where icu_expire_flag = 1 but expire_flag = 0, which is good.

# I will create my own ICU expire flag by flagging patients who died while they were staying in an ICU.
# Because there are 2,561 patients who died before or on the ICU exit date but flagged 0.
pt_icu_outcome_expflag <- pt_icu_outcome_asdate_2 %>% 
  mutate(icu_expire_flag_2 = ifelse(is.na(dod_d), 0, 
                                    ifelse(dod_d <= outtime_d, 1, icu_expire_flag))
         )

# Check the new variable
sum(pt_icu_outcome_expflag$icu_expire_flag_2, na.rm=TRUE)
# There 2,561 ICU mortality, which account for 7.87% of ICU patients. This rate is comparable to the published rate.

# add weekend flag
pt_icu_outcome_wkndflag <- pt_icu_outcome_expflag %>%
  mutate(weekend = ifelse(lubridate::wday(intime_d) %in% c(1, 7), 1, 0))
# 6,897 out of 32,555 ICU admissions (21.2%) are on weekends.

# I will use this flag as the outcome. Dropping unused variables.
pt_icu_outcome_clean <- pt_icu_outcome_wkndflag %>% select(!c("admittime", "dischtime", "intime", "outtime", "hosp_deathtime", "dod", "icu_expire_flag", "ttd_days"))
```
```{r}
# sanity check
Hmisc::describe(pt_icu_outcome_clean)
```
There are a total of 32,556 patient aged 18 years old and older. The lowest length of stay is 1 day. The ICU mortality rate is `r round(2562*100/32556, 2)`%, comparable to the published rate. The rate here is different to the published rate because this is a subset of the published population.

32,556 selected ICU stays have vital signs data available. The spO2, temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, glucose, and mean arterial blood pressure have unrealistic values.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset provides data on 32,556 patients aged 18 years or older who were admitted to stayed in ICUs 24 hours or longer. The dataset contains only the first ICU admission of each patient. Age ranged from 18 to 91.4 years, with a median of 66 years (interquartile range (IQR): 52-77 years), and 56.8% of patients were men. Most patients (71.3%) were white. 5,739 patients (17.6%) were admitted on weekends. Most admissions (83.7%) were either emergency or urgent. Most patients were first admitted to medical ICUs ("MICU") (34.4%) and cardiac surgery recovery units ("CSRU") (21.4%). Most common groups of diagnoses were other (92.8%) and circulatory disorders (83.7%). 26.4% of patients were intubated within the first 24 hours. Length of stay ranged from 1 to 153.9 days with a median of 2.5 days (IQR: 1.6-4.8 days). 2,562 patients (7.87%) died in their first ICU admissions.

# Question 2: Weekend Effect in ICU 

Task: To investigate whether admission to ICU at the weekend increases the risk of ICU mortality 

Objective: To develop a statistical model to estimate the effect of weekend admission to ICU on the risk of ICU mortality. 

Question: Does admission to ICU over the weekend increase the risk of ICU mortality? 

Study Population: First ICU admissions of adults in the MIMIC-III dataset

## Methods

I will use multivariable Cox-proportional hazards regression model to evaluate the effect of weekend admission on ICU mortality.

## Results

```{r survival_plot}
ggsurvplot(survfit(Surv(los, icu_expire_flag_2) ~ weekend, data=alldata_q2), 
              data = alldata_q2,
              palette = "Set2",
              ggtheme = theme_minimal(),
              xlab = "Survival (days)",
              surv.median.line = 'hv',
              pval=TRUE,
              title = "Survival plot of ICU admissions stratified by weekend admission")

```
Survival of ICU patients does not seem to be different between weekend and weekday admissions from visual observation. However, p = 0.018 indicates a statistically significant difference. 

Fit a univariable Cox model for each variables in the dataset. Then, fit a multivariable Cox model including all of the variables that were statistically significant in the univariable Cox models.

```{r}
# univariate analyses on all variables
univariate <- alldata_q2 %>%
  tbl_uvregression(
    method = coxph,
    y = Surv(time = los, event = icu_expire_flag_2),
    exponentiate = TRUE,
    pvalue_fun = ~ style_pvalue(.x, digits = 2)
  ) %>%
  bold_p() # bold p-values under a given threshold (default 0.05)
```

```{r multivariable}
# multivariate analysis of variables with p<0.05 on univariate analyses
multi_1 <- coxph(Surv(los, icu_expire_flag_2) ~ age_years + weekend + gender + admission_type_2 + ethnicity_2 + Genitourinary + Circulatory + Neoplasms + Trauma + first_careunit + spo2_min + temperature_min + resprate_min + sysbp_min + diasbp_min + glucose_min.x + meanarterialpressure_min + spo2_max + temperature_max + resprate_max + heartrate_max + sysbp_max + diasbp_max + glucose_max.x + whitebloodcell_min + bicarbonate_min + bloodureanitrogen_min + creatinine_min + chloride_min + hematocrit_min + whitebloodcell_max + bicarbonate_max + bloodureanitrogen_max + creatinine_max + sodium_max + hematocrit_max + gcs_min + gcs_max + endotrachflag + weight + positiveculture + antibioticresistance_R + norepinephrine_24hr + epinephrine_24hr + dopamine_24hr + dobutamine_24hr + mechvent_24hr, data = alldata_q2)
multivariate <- tbl_regression(multi_1, exponentiate = TRUE) %>%
  bold_p()

# combine univariate and multevariate in one table
tbl_merge(list(univariate, multivariate),
          tab_spanner = c("**Univariable**", "**Multivariable**"))
```

```{r multivariate_2}
# Include variables with p<0.05 into a new multivariate model
multi_2 <- coxph(Surv(los, icu_expire_flag_2) ~ weekend + age_years + admission_type_2 + ethnicity_2 + Genitourinary + Neoplasms + Trauma + first_careunit + spo2_min + temperature_min + sysbp_min + diasbp_min + glucose_min.x + meanarterialpressure_min + spo2_max + temperature_max + resprate_max + heartrate_max + whitebloodcell_min + bicarbonate_min + bloodureanitrogen_min + chloride_min + hematocrit_min + bloodureanitrogen_max + sodium_max + hematocrit_max + gcs_min + gcs_max + endotrachflag + weight + mechvent_24hr, data = alldata_q2)

tbl_regression(multi_2, exponentiate = TRUE) %>%
  bold_p()

# model comparison with ANOVA test
anova(multi_2, multi_1, test='Chisq')
# A nonsignificant p-value (>0.05) indicates that the smaller model is preferred.

# model comparison with AIC values
extractAIC(multi_1)
extractAIC(multi_2)
# The smaller model provides a smaller AIC value. Thus, the smaller model is preferred.
```

```{r}
# test for Cox proportional hazards assumption
cox.zph(multi_2)
```
The test indicates that the proportional hazards assumption is violated for a large portion of variables (p < 0.05). The global test also indicates the assumption is invalid (p < 0.001).

I will categorize these continuous variables and stratify categorical variables.
